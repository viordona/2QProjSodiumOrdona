<p class = "BodyText"> You will be responsible for all delivery charges. The delivery charge will reflect in your total amount to pay. Therefore, please make sure that you are satisfied with the delivery charge before proceeding with your transaction. <br> <br> To get an idea of delivery charges, visit <a href = "https://www.jrs-express.com/rates/" target="_blank"> JRS Rate Calculator</a>. For the protection of our bags, at this time, we only use <a href ="https://www.jrs-express.com/" target="_blank"> JRS Service</a>.  <br> <br> Your order will be delivered to the delivery address specified and keyed in by you on the order form. You will receive your order via the JRS courier service. We advise that either you or a chosen representative receive the order and place it in a safe place. <br> <br> We aim to deliver your order within the estimated timeframes indicated below, from when the Dispatch Confirmation is issued. However, we cannot guarantee any firm delivery dates upon order. To the extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable to you for any losses, liabilities, costs, damages, charges, or expenses arising out of late delivery. <br> <br> Location estimated delivery is as follows: <br> Metro Manila: 1-3 Working Days <br> Outside Metro Manila: 3-9 Working Days <br> Note: Working Days shall exclude all National Holidays.</p>
<p class = "BodyText"> <br> On delivery of your order, you shall examine it immediately for any deficiencies and damages. <br> <br> Once delivered, your  order will become your responsibility. Except concerning damaged or faulty orders when delivered or have been incorrectly delivered, we will not accept any liability for their loss, damage, or destruction. <br> <br> Your order will come with a tag. If you are not satisfied with your order, do not remove the tag, and contact us immediately. </p>
<p class = "BodyText"> <br> You can make an exchange or refund for the following reasons: </p>
<p class = "BodyText"> <ul id = "BodyList1"> <li> If there is damage to your order at the time of deliver </li> <li> If your order is different from the item delivered </ul> </p>
<p class = "BodyText"> <br> Only under the above conditions will LadyBug pay for return shipping.  Please allow 2-3 business days for transaction to be processed. <br> <br> Returns or exchanges are only accepted if the tag is still in place and shipped back to us within 24 hours or within one business day from when you receive it. <br> <br> Please note that it might not be possible for us to deliver to some locations. If this is the case, we will inform you using the contact details you have provided when you made your order and arrange for cancellation of the order or delivery to an alternative delivery address. <br> <br> If you cannot receive your delivery, we will send you an SMS notifying you of the failed delivery attempt. In addition, we will inform you of the subsequent delivery attempts, but upon a failed third attempt, we will consider the delivery as failed, and we will cancel the order. </p>
<p class = "BodyText"> <br> If delivery or collection is delayed through your unreasonable refusal to accept it or if you refuse to get it  from the carrier, then we may (without affecting any other right or remedy available to us) do either or both of the following: </p>
<p class = "BodyText"> <ol id = "BodyList2"> <li> Charge you for our reasonable storage fee and other costs reasonably incurred by us; or </li> <li> No longer make the order available for delivery and notify you that we are immediately canceling the order. </li> </ol> </p>
<p class = "BodyText"> <br> In which case, we will refund you any money already paid to us under the order, less our reasonable administration charges, including for attempting to deliver and then returning the order, and any storage fees as provided. </p>

<p class = "SubTitles"> <br> Ship/Return Box, Dust Bag, Other Items </p>
<p class = "BodyText"> Return your bag via the nearest JRS service. Attach the return label that came with your package. <br> <br> You should ship your order back to us within 24 hours after the last day of the rental period.  However, if you want to extend your rental period, notify us via email before your rental period is up, and we will send you instructions on what to do. The extension will be on a monthly basis. <br> <br> If a bag you return has damage above normal wear and tear, you will be responsible for the total retail price, plus 12% sales tax and a replacement fee of P1000.00. <br> <br> The replacement fee will be different for each bag. Please refer retail costs under <a href = "content.html" target = "_blank"> BAGS</a>. If you do not agree with the replacement fee, you should NOT rent the bag. <br> <br> In case of failure to pay any debt or to return an item when due, you will be liable to LoveBug for damages, including but not limited to the rent payment of the item, calculated monthly, until said item is received by LoveBug in an undamaged condition. <br> <br> You will be considered in DEFAULT if your bag is not returned immediately after your rental period has expired, or you failed to pay for an extension of your rent for a month.  30 days after the date of default, LoveBug has the option to charge you the replacement fee of the bag, plus 1 month rent from the date of default, or seek to recover the wrongfully-retained bag plus all rent owed to the date of recovery of the undamaged item. If suit is filed, LoveBug may assert these measures of damage simultaneously. <br> <br> If you have any questions about the replacement fee of the bag you rent or the one you plan to rent, do not hesitate to get in touch with us. </p>
